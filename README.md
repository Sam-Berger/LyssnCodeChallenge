# LyssnCodeChallenge

Here is my code for the Lyssn Code Challenge. This was a fun project to take on because it was quick and easy. The most difficult part was matching the box shadow, since that just has to be eyeballed. Thank you for your consideration for the position of Front End Developer at Lyssn.
